# 3. **Core Concepts**

This section delves deeper into the fundamental building blocks of Valyrian.js, explaining how the virtual DOM, components, directives, and events interact. Understanding these concepts is crucial to taking full advantage of Valyrian.js in your projects.

## 3.1. Virtual DOM and Vnode

Valyrian.js is built around the concept of a virtual DOM, which allows for efficient updates to the user interface by comparing virtual representations of the UI with the actual DOM. This approach minimizes costly DOM operations and leads to better performance, particularly on resource-constrained devices.

### 3.1.1. What is a Vnode?

A **Vnode** (Virtual Node) is a lightweight, plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM element, component, or text node in the virtual DOM tree. Instead of directly interacting with DOM elements, Valyrian.js uses Vnodes to abstract the UI structure, enabling efficient updates by comparing the old and new virtual DOM.

When you define a UI element using JSX or the `v` function, it creates a Vnode. Below is an example of how a Vnode is represented internally:

**Example: Vnode Representation**

When you create the following JSX:

```jsx
const vnode = (
  <div id="example" class="container">
    Hello World
  </div>
);
```

It gets transformed into a Vnode that looks like this:

```javascript
const vnode = {
  tag: "div", // The HTML tag name
  props: {
    // Attributes and properties of the element
    id: "example",
    class: "container"
  },
  children: ["Hello World"], // Child nodes (text, Vnodes, or components)
  dom: undefined, // DOM reference (populated after mounting)
  isSVG: false // Indicates if the element is an SVG
};
```

This Vnode is a blueprint of the desired DOM structure. It is passed to Valyrian.js, which handles the process of comparing this blueprint with the actual DOM and updating only the parts that have changed.

**How Vnodes Work in the Virtual DOM:**

1. **Initial Render:** The Vnode is created from the JSX and converted into the corresponding DOM elements.
2. **Update:** When state or props change, a new Vnode is generated. Valyrian.js compares the new Vnode with the previous one to determine the differences.
3. **Patch:** Only the parts of the DOM that differ are updated, minimizing expensive DOM operations.

**Practical Example:**

```jsx
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";

const App = () => (
  <div id="app" class="main">
    Welcome to Valyrian.js
  </div>
);

mount("body", <App />);
```

- **Generated Vnode:**

  ```javascript
  {
    tag: "div",
    props: { id: "app", class: "main" },
    children: ["Welcome to Valyrian.js"],
    dom: undefined,
    isSVG: false
  }
  ```

- **Resulting DOM:**
  ```html
  <div id="app" class="main">Welcome to Valyrian.js</div>
  ```

This abstraction allows Valyrian.js to efficiently update and manage the DOM by working with Vnodes rather than directly manipulating the DOM itself.

### 3.1.2. Hyperscript & JSX/TSX

Valyrian.js uses a function called `v` (hyperscript) to create Vnodes. Hyperscript allows you to write code that looks like function calls but produces a tree of virtual nodes. While writing code directly in hyperscript is possible, using **JSX** or **TSX** is more common and more intuitive for developers familiar with HTML-like syntax.

**Key Differences:**

- **Hyperscript**: Manually calls the `v` function to create Vnodes.\
  _Example (Hyperscript)_:

  ```javascript
  import { v } from "valyrian.js";

  const HelloWorld = v("div", null, "Hello World");
  ```

- **JSX/TSX**: Allows you to write HTML-like syntax that gets transformed into hyperscript calls under the hood.\
  _Example (JSX)_:

  ```jsx
  import { v } from "valyrian.js";

  const HelloWorld = <div>Hello World</div>;
  ```

Valyrian.js requires importing the `v` function for Vnode creation, even when using JSX. The JSX is compiled at build time, transforming the JSX syntax into `v` calls.

### 3.1.3. Creating and Using Vnodes

You can create a Vnode in one of two main ways:

1. **Using Hyperscript Directly**:

   ```javascript
   import { v } from "valyrian.js";
   const vnode = v("div", { id: "my-div" }, "Hello World");
   ```

2. **Using JSX**:
   ```jsx
   import { v } from "valyrian.js";
   const vnode = <div id="my-div">Hello World</div>;
   ```

Once created, you can mount a Vnode to the DOM using the `mount` function:

```javascript
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";
mount("body", vnode);
```

This will replace the contents of the `<body>` with your Vnode’s rendered output. Subsequent updates to the state of your application will automatically update the actual DOM in the most efficient way possible.

---

## 3.2. Components

Components are a central concept in Valyrian.js, providing a way to encapsulate and reuse UI logic. Components can be defined as functional functions, plain old JavaScript objects (POJO), or classes. All components ultimately return Vnodes (either directly or through JSX).

**Note:** While Valyrian.js supports multiple component paradigms, remember that the lifecycle in Valyrian.js is tied to Vnodes rather than components themselves. Components are re-invoked each render cycle. To manage side effects or lifecycle-like behavior, you can rely on directives and hooks. This approach ensures consistency and simplicity in the rendering process.

### 3.2.1. Functional Components

Functional components are the simplest form of components. They are just JavaScript functions that return a Vnode. Since you can now rely on JSX, define your components using JSX syntax:

```jsx
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";

const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  return <div>Hello {props.name}</div>;
};

mount("body", <HelloWorld name="Valyrian" />);
```

**Key Points:**

- Functional components are stateless by default.
- If you need state, use hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- Props are passed as the first argument, and children are passed as the second argument if needed.

### 3.2.2. Object-Based (POJO) and Class-Based Components

**Object-Based (POJO) Components:**\
A POJO component is a plain JavaScript object with a `view` method returning a Vnode.

```jsx
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";

const HelloWorld = {
  id: "greeting",
  view(props) {
    return <div id={this.id}>Hello {props.name}</div>;
  }
};

mount("body", <HelloWorld name="Valyrian" />);
```

**Class-Based Components:**\
Class-based components are ES6 classes that define a `view` method.

```jsx
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";

class HelloWorld {
  constructor() {
    this.id = "greeting";
  }
  view(props) {
    return <div id={this.id}>Hello {props.name}</div>;
  }
}

const instance = new HelloWorld();
mount("body", <instance name="Valyrian" />);
```

**Key Points:**

- POJO and class-based components can hold properties and methods.
- They do not have their own lifecycle hooks like in some other frameworks. Instead, rely on vnode directives and hooks for side effects.
- Re-rendering a component calls the view function or method again, effectively “recreating” the component’s output. Use hooks or external state management techniques to maintain state across renders.

### 3.2.3. Component Lifecycle (Vnode Lifecycle)

In Valyrian.js, lifecycle behaviors are associated with Vnodes rather than the components themselves. When a component function is called on every render, it returns a Vnode. This Vnode can then have certain directives (`v-create`, `v-update`, `v-cleanup`) that act like lifecycle hooks at the Vnode level:

- **`v-create`**: Runs when a Vnode is created for the first time.
- **`v-update`**: Runs when a Vnode is updated.
- **`v-cleanup`**: Runs before a Vnode is updated or removed, allowing you to clean up side effects.

For side effects and managing state, rely on hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and others provided by Valyrian.js. These hooks are re-run when components re-render, giving you a predictable and consistent way to manage your component’s behavior over time.

**Example: Using Directives for Lifecycle-like Behaviors**

```jsx
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";

const LifecycleExample = () => {
  return (
    <div
      v-create={(vnode) => console.log("Vnode created:", vnode)}
      v-update={(vnode, oldProps) => console.log("Vnode updated:", vnode, oldProps)}
      v-cleanup={(vnode) => console.log("Vnode cleaned up:", vnode)}
    >
      Lifecycle Example
    </div>
  );
};

mount("body", <LifecycleExample />);
```

**Note:** Hooks such as `useEffect` can also be used to simulate lifecycle behavior at the component level, running on creation, updates, and teardown.

---

## 3.3. Events and Handlers

Events in Valyrian.js are managed using standard DOM event names, prefixed with `on`. However, Valyrian.js uses event delegation internally to handle events more efficiently. When an event occurs, Valyrian.js determines the appropriate handler to call by traversing up the DOM tree.

### 3.3.1. Event Delegation

Valyrian.js attaches event listeners at a higher level rather than on each individual element. This reduces the number of event listeners and improves performance.

**Example: Handling Click Events**

```jsx
import { mount } from "valyrian.js";

let count = 0;
const Counter = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onclick={() => count++}>Count: {count}</button>
    </div>
  );
};

mount("body", <Counter />);
```

Each time the button is clicked, the `onclick` function increments `count`. Valyrian.js updates the DOM efficiently.

---

## 3.4. Directives

Directives in Valyrian.js are special attributes prefixed with `v-` that enable declarative and powerful manipulation of DOM elements and Vnodes. They allow you to add conditional rendering, dynamic styling, event handling, lifecycle callbacks, and data binding directly within your templates. This approach keeps your code concise, expressive, and easy to maintain.

Valyrian.js provides a set of built-in directives covering various common use cases. Additionally, you can create custom directives to tailor the framework’s behavior to your project’s requirements.

### 3.4.1 Categories of Directives

1. **Structural & Conditional Rendering**:

   - `v-if`
   - `v-for`
   - `v-show`

2. **Styling & Content Manipulation**:

   - `v-class`
   - `v-text`
   - `v-html`

3. **Data Binding**:

   - `v-model`

4. **Lifecycle-Related**:
   - `v-create`
   - `v-update`
   - `v-cleanup`
   - `v-keep`

### 3.4.2. Structural & Conditional Rendering Directives

**`v-if`**

- **Purpose:** Conditionally render elements based on a Boolean expression.
- **Behavior:** If the expression is falsy, the element is not rendered in the DOM; if truthy, it is rendered.

**Example:**

```jsx
let showMessage = true;
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <span v-if={showMessage}>Hello, World!</span>
  </div>
);

// Initially renders: <div><span>Hello, World!</span></div>
// If `showMessage` is set to `false` and updated:
// <div></div>
```

---

**`v-for`**

- **Purpose:** Render a list of elements by iterating over an array.
- **Behavior:** Requires an array as its value and a callback function as a child. The callback is invoked for each array element, returning a Vnode for each item.

**Example:**

```jsx
const items = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"];
const List = () => (
  <ul v-for={items}>
    {(item, index) => (
      <li>
        {index} - {item}
      </li>
    )}
  </ul>
);

// Renders:
// <ul>
//   <li>0 - alpha</li>
//   <li>1 - beta</li>
//   <li>2 - gamma</li>
// </ul>
```

---

**`v-show`**

- **Purpose:** Toggle the visibility of an element by adjusting its `display` style without removing it from the DOM.
- **Behavior:** If the value is truthy, the element is shown; if falsy, the element’s `display` is set to `none`.

**Example:**

```jsx
let isVisible = false;
const VisibilityToggle = () => (
  <div>
    <span v-show={isVisible}>You can see me if isVisible is true!</span>
  </div>
);

// With isVisible = false:
// <div><span style="display: none;">You can see me if isVisible is true!</span></div>
// If `isVisible` is set to true and updated:
// <div><span>You can see me if isVisible is true!</span></div>
```

### 3.4.3. Styling & Content Manipulation Directives

**`v-class`**

- **Purpose:** Dynamically apply classes to an element.
- **Behavior:**
  - If value is a string, it sets the element’s `className` to that string.
  - If value is an array, it joins the array items into a space-separated class string.
  - If value is an object, each key’s Boolean value determines whether that class is toggled on or off.

**Examples:**

```jsx
// String value
<div v-class="highlight" />

// Array value
<div v-class={["highlight", "bold"]} />

// Object value
const classes = { highlight: true, invisible: false };
<div v-class={classes} />
```

---

**`v-text`**

- **Purpose:** Set the element’s text content directly.
- **Behavior:** Replaces any children with the given text, ensuring a text-only node.

**Example:**

```jsx
<div v-text="Hello Valyrian.js" />
// Renders: <div>Hello Valyrian.js</div>
```

_Note:_ `v-text` is rarely needed if you can simply pass a string as a child in JSX. However, it’s useful when ensuring a node is strictly text without additional children or markup.

---

**`v-html`**

- **Purpose:** Insert raw HTML as the content of the element.
- **Behavior:** The string value is parsed and converted into Vnodes representing the HTML nodes, effectively rendering raw HTML.

**Example:**

```jsx
<div v-html="<p>Hello <strong>Valyrian.js</strong></p>" />
// Renders: <div><p>Hello <strong>Valyrian.js</strong></p></div>
```

_Caution:_ `v-html` can introduce security risks if the HTML string is not sanitized. Use it with trusted content only.

### 3.4.4. Data Binding Directive

**`v-model`**

- **Purpose:** Two-way data binding between an element’s value and a property in your model or state.
- **Behavior:** Changes to the input update the model, and changes to the model update the input’s displayed value or checked state.
- **Requirements:** The element must have a `name` attribute in its `props` to identify which property of the model to bind.

**Supported Elements & Behaviors:**

1. **Text Inputs, Textareas:**

   - Binds the input’s `value` to the model property.
   - On `input` event, updates the model property.

   **Example (Text Input):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { message: "Hello" };
   const TextInput = () => <input type="text" name="message" v-model={model} />;
   // Initial render sets value="Hello"
   // Editing the input updates model.message
   ```

   **Example (Textarea):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { content: "Initial text" };
   const TextAreaExample = () => <textarea name="content" v-model={model}></textarea>;
   // Sets the textarea content to "Initial text"
   // Editing the textarea updates model.content
   ```

2. **Checkbox Inputs:**

   - If the model property is a Boolean, toggles between true/false.
   - If the model property is an array, adds/removes the checkbox’s value from the array.

   **Example (Checkbox Boolean):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { agree: false };
   const CheckboxExample = () => <input type="checkbox" name="agree" v-model={model} />;
   // Initially unchecked: model.agree = false
   // Checking sets model.agree = true
   ```

   **Example (Checkbox Array):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { selections: [] };
   const CheckboxArrayExample = () => (
     <>
       <input type="checkbox" name="selections" value="option1" v-model={model} />
       <input type="checkbox" name="selections" value="option2" v-model={model} />
     </>
   );
   // Checking "option1" pushes it into model.selections = ["option1"]
   // Checking "option2" afterwards sets model.selections = ["option1", "option2"]
   // Unchecking removes it from the array
   ```

3. **Radio Inputs:**

   - If the model property matches the radio’s value, that radio is checked.
   - Changing the radio updates the model property to the new value.

   **Example (Radio):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { choice: "A" };
   const RadioExample = () => (
     <>
       <input type="radio" name="choice" value="A" v-model={model} /> A
       <input type="radio" name="choice" value="B" v-model={model} /> B
     </>
   );
   // Initially, "A" is checked since model.choice = "A"
   // Selecting B sets model.choice = "B"
   ```

4. **Select Elements (Single & Multiple):**

   - For single select, the chosen option sets the model property.
   - For multiple select, if `multiple` is true, you can hold multiple values. Holding Ctrl while selecting allows toggling options in the model array.

   **Example (Single Select):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { fruit: "apple" };
   const SelectExample = () => (
     <select name="fruit" v-model={model}>
       <option value="apple">Apple</option>
       <option value="banana">Banana</option>
     </select>
   );
   // Initially selects "apple" because model.fruit = "apple"
   // Changing to "banana" sets model.fruit = "banana"
   ```

   **Example (Multiple Select):**

   ```jsx
   const model = { selectedItems: ["apple"] };
   const MultiSelectExample = () => (
     <select name="selectedItems" multiple v-model={model}>
       <option value="apple">Apple</option>
       <option value="banana">Banana</option>
       <option value="cherry">Cherry</option>
     </select>
   );
   // Initially "apple" is selected
   // Ctrl + click "banana" adds "banana" -> model.selectedItems = ["apple", "banana"]
   // Ctrl + click "apple" again removes "apple" from the array
   ```

### 3.4.5. Lifecycle-Related Directives

These directives don’t map directly to component lifecycles like in other frameworks. Instead, they run at the Vnode level, making it possible to handle side effects and cleanups more consistently.

**`v-create`**

- **Purpose:** Runs a callback when the Vnode is created for the first time.
- **Behavior:** The callback receives the Vnode as an argument. If it returns a cleanup function, that function will be called on cleanup.

**Example:**

```jsx
<div
  v-create={(vnode) => {
    console.log("Vnode created:", vnode);
    return () => console.log("Cleanup on next update or removal");
  }}
>
  Example
</div>
```

---

**`v-update`**

- **Purpose:** Runs a callback whenever the Vnode updates.
- **Behavior:** The callback receives the new Vnode and the old props. If it returns a cleanup function, that will be called before the next update.

**Example:**

```jsx
<div
  v-update={(newVnode, oldProps) => {
    console.log("Vnode updated:", newVnode, oldProps);
    return () => console.log("Cleanup before next update");
  }}
>
  Example
</div>
```

---

**`v-cleanup`**

- **Purpose:** Runs a callback right before the Vnode is updated or removed, allowing you to perform cleanup actions.
- **Behavior:** Useful for tearing down event listeners or intervals.

**Example:**

```jsx
<div v-cleanup={(vnode) => console.log("Cleaning up:", vnode)}>Example</div>
```

---

**`v-keep`**

- **Purpose:** Prevents a Vnode from being updated once it is rendered, unless its `v-keep` value changes.
- **Behavior:** On the first render, Valyrian.js creates the DOM elements. Subsequent updates do not affect the Vnode’s DOM unless the `v-keep` value itself changes, at which point a re-render occurs. This helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary updates for content that does not need to change frequently.

**Example: Static Content Optimization**\
If you have a section of your application that never changes after the initial render, you can use `v-keep` to skip updates altogether:

```jsx
const StaticSection = () => (
  <div v-keep>
    <h1>Application Title</h1>
    <p>Some static content that never updates</p>
  </div>
);
```

No matter how many times you call `update()`, this section remains unchanged, saving computation time.

**Example: Dynamic Value Optimization**\
If you need the content to update only when a particular state has changed, bind `v-keep` to a property that changes infrequently:

```jsx
let currentVersion = 1;
const InfoSection = () => (
  <div v-keep={currentVersion}>
    <h2>Documentation for version {currentVersion}</h2>
    <p>This content updates only when the version number changes.</p>
  </div>
);

// Initially renders with currentVersion = 1
// Changing other app states and calling update() does not affect this Vnode
// If you set currentVersion = 2 and then call update(), the Vnode re-renders with the new version.
```

By using `v-keep`, you selectively control when a section of your UI should be re-rendered, improving performance in areas where content is mostly static.

### 3.4.6. Reserved Words: `key` and `state`

**`key`**

- **Purpose:** Used when dealing with lists of elements, especially with `v-for`, to help Valyrian.js track and re-use DOM elements efficiently.
- **Behavior:** Assign a unique `key` to each item’s Vnode to improve rendering performance and maintain state during updates.

**Example:**

```jsx
const items = [
  { id: 1, text: "One" },
  { id: 2, text: "Two" }
];
<ul>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <li key={item.id}>{item.text}</li>
  ))}
</ul>;
```

**`state`**

- **Purpose:** A reserved prop that you can set on a Vnode to pass data internally without rendering it as an attribute.
- **Behavior:** Useful in lifecycle directives (`v-create`, `v-update`, `v-cleanup`) to store or check state between updates.
- **Note:** `state` does not render as an HTML attribute.

**Example:**

```jsx
const someState = { counter: 0 };
const App = () => (
  <div
    state={someState}
    v-update={(newVnode, oldProps) => {
      // Access the state without it appearing in the DOM
      if (oldProps.state.counter !== newVnode.props.state.counter) {
        console.log("Counter changed");
      }
    }}
  >
    Stateful Example
  </div>
);
```

### 3.4.7. Creating Custom Directives

While Valyrian.js provides a rich set of built-in directives, you might encounter scenarios where custom behaviors are needed. Custom directives let you directly manipulate Vnodes and take advantage of the framework’s virtual DOM diffing process to add or modify functionality declaratively.

**Key Considerations for Custom Directives:**

1. **Directive Registration:**\
   Use the `directive` function to register a custom directive. The directive’s name will be used as `v-my-directive` in your templates.

   ```javascript
   import { directive } from "valyrian.js";

   directive("my-directive", (value, vnode, oldProps) => {
     // Custom logic here
   });
   ```

2. **Directive Function Signature:**
   Each directive function receives three arguments:

   - **value:** The value passed to the directive (e.g., `v-my-directive="someValue"` means `value = "someValue"`).
   - **vnode:** The current Vnode being processed. You can inspect or modify `vnode.props`, `vnode.children`, and other Vnode properties before the DOM is updated.
   - **oldProps:** The Vnode’s old props from the previous render, or `null` if it’s the first render. Use `oldProps` to detect changes between updates.

3. **When and How Directives Run:**
   Directives execute during the patching process, when Valyrian.js compares the old and new Vnodes and updates the DOM accordingly. This timing allows you to adjust the Vnode before the final DOM patch is applied. On initial render, `oldProps` is `null`. On subsequent renders, `oldProps` allows you to determine what has changed since the last update.

4. **Modifying Vnode Properties and Children:**

   - Directives commonly alter `vnode.props` or `vnode.children` to influence how the DOM is ultimately rendered.
   - If your logic depends on the old and new states, you can compare `value` or `vnode.props[name]` and `oldProps[name]` for differences.

   **Important Note About Property Modification:**\
   The patching and directive execution order is not guaranteed for each property, meaning that if your directive tries to modify a property that has already been processed, it may not take effect. To reliably update a property after the initial attribute processing, use the built-in `setAttribute` function.

   `setAttribute` ensures that your changes are correctly applied to the current Vnode’s properties and reflected in the final DOM. This approach is safer than directly mutating `vnode.props` at a late stage because `setAttribute` integrates with Valyrian.js’s patch logic, ensuring your updates are not lost.

5. **Returning Values and Stopping Execution:**

   - If a directive returns `false`, Valyrian.js stops processing further directives on that Vnode.
   - Use this to conditionally halt updates if certain conditions are not met.

6. **Avoiding Side Effects in Directives:**
   Directives should focus on Vnode transformations and DOM-related logic.\
   For side effects (like adding event listeners, timers, or subscriptions), consider using lifecycle directives (`v-create`, `v-update`, `v-cleanup`) or hooks. Keeping directives pure and focused simplifies maintenance and testing.

**Example: Creating and Using a Custom Directive with setAttribute**

```jsx
import { mount, directive, setAttribute } from "valyrian.js";

// A directive that ensures text is uppercase and updates a custom attribute
directive("uppercase-attr", (value, vnode, oldProps) => {
  // Convert children text to uppercase
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    vnode.children = [value.toUpperCase()];
  }

  // If we need to ensure a certain attribute is updated even if other directives ran first:
  // Use setAttribute to reliably apply the change.
  setAttribute("data-original-text", value, vnode);

  // If this directive is executed after patching other attributes, using setAttribute ensures
  // that our changes are properly integrated into the final DOM update cycle.
});

const App = () => <div v-uppercase-attr="hello valyrian.js" />;

mount("body", <App />);
// Renders: <div data-original-text="hello valyrian.js">HELLO VALYRIAN.JS</div>
```

**Best Practices for Custom Directives:**

- **Use `setAttribute` for Reliable Property Updates:**\
  When updating existing properties late in the patch process, prefer `setAttribute` instead of directly mutating `vnode.props`. This ensures your modifications are integrated correctly and not overridden by earlier directives or updates.

- **Keep Directives Focused on Vnode Transformations:**\
  Directives should primarily modify `vnode.props` or `vnode.children`. Avoid implementing complex business logic or side effects directly in directives. If you need to manage event listeners, timers, or subscriptions, rely on lifecycle directives (`v-create`, `v-update`, `v-cleanup`) or hooks instead. For delegated events you can use `setAttribute` too and will make Valyrian.js handle the event delegation.

- **Leverage `oldProps` for Change Detection:**\
  By comparing `value` with `oldProps`, you can determine if something changed between renders and conditionally apply updates.

- **Return `false` to Halt Further Directive Processing:**\
  If a certain condition is not met, returning `false` stops subsequent directives and properties from running on the same Vnode, allowing you to control the update flow.
