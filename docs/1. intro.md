# 1. Valyrian.js

**Lightweight steel to forge PWAs.**

## 1.1. What is Valyrian.js?

Valyrian.js is a minimalist JavaScript framework crafted to simplify the creation of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and Single Page Applications (SPAs). It aims to provide developers with a lightweight and efficient toolset to build dynamic, high-performance user interfaces optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Valyrian.js is **isomorphic**, enabling server-side rendering (SSR) without altering the application's core structure. This is achieved with minimal configuration, particularly within the request module to direct API calls appropriately to the local server.

### **Hyperscript and JSX**

Valyrian.js leverages **hyperscript**, a lightweight abstraction for creating virtual DOM nodes. This allows developers to write **JSX**, a syntax extension that resembles HTML, which Valyrian.js compiles into hyperscript calls for efficient rendering. This approach ensures that components remain declarative and easy to understand while maintaining high performance.

#### **Example: Hyperscript vs. JSX**

```javascript
import { v } from "valyrian.js";

// JSX Syntax
const HelloWorldJSXVnode = <div>Hello World</div>;

// Equivalent Hyperscript Syntax
const HelloWorldHyperscriptVnode = v("div", null, "Hello World");
```

**Explanation:**

- **JSX Syntax:** JSX provides a familiar and concise way to define components using HTML-like syntax.
- **Hyperscript Syntax:** JSX is compiled into hyperscript calls, the underlying mechanism for creating virtual DOM nodes in Valyrian.js.
- **`v` Function:** The `v` function is used to create virtual DOM nodes. Regardless of the syntax used, importing the `v` function is necessary to create elements.

## 1.2. Objectives of Valyrian.js

Valyrian.js is designed to streamline the web development process by addressing common limitations and challenges found in existing frameworks. Its primary focus areas include:

- **Enhancing Performance:** Delivering high-speed rendering and efficient updates, especially crucial for mobile devices.
- **Reducing Complexity:** Offering a straightforward API and modular structure to simplify development workflows.
- **Optimizing User Experience:** Ensuring smooth interactions and fast load times to provide an excellent user experience across devices.

## 1.3. Key Features

Valyrian.js is packed with features that make it a robust choice for modern web development:

- **Efficient Virtual DOM:** Utilizes an optimized Virtual DOM to update the interface swiftly and accurately, minimizing operations on the real DOM.
- **Flexible Components:** Supports functional, object-based (POJO), and class-based components, allowing for a modular and reusable code structure.
- **Built-in Directives:** Includes directives similar to those in popular frameworks (`v-if`, `v-show`, `v-model`, etc.), facilitating declarative DOM manipulation.
- **Simplified Reactivity:** Implements a reactivity system through hooks and pulses, enabling the interface to automatically update when the state changes.
- **Centralized State Management:** Provides a Flux-inspired store to manage the global state of the application predictably and efficiently.
- **Powerful Routing:** Offers an integrated router with support for middlewares, dynamic routes, and error handling, simplifying navigation in SPA applications.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Designed to deliver excellent performance on mobile devices, ensuring fast load times and smooth interactions.
- **Support for SSR (Server-Side Rendering):** Facilitates rendering the application on the server, enhancing performance, user experience, and SEO by reducing initial load times.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Includes tools for managing multiple languages and formatting numbers and currencies, making it easier to create multilingual applications.
- **Integrated Service Workers:** Simplifies the creation and registration of service workers to enhance offline experiences and application performance.
- **Lightweight and Modular Design:** Engineered to be small and efficient, including only what you need and allowing for the addition of modules as required.

## 1.4. Differentiation from Other Frameworks

Valyrian.js stands out among other JavaScript frameworks by offering:

- **Performance Comparable to Inferno.js:** Engineered for speed, Valyrian.js delivers performance on par with Inferno.js, ensuring highly responsive and efficient applications.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Specific optimizations enhance performance and user experience on mobile platforms, guaranteeing quick load times and smooth interactions.
- **Integrated Routing and Middleware Support:** Unlike frameworks like React and Vue.js, which rely on external libraries for routing, Valyrian.js provides a built-in router with middleware support, simplifying navigation and route protection.
- **Server-Side Component Rendering:** Facilitates SSR directly within the framework without requiring separate tools or complex configurations.
- **Multiple Component Paradigms:** Supporting functional, object-based, and class-based components offers developers flexibility in structuring their applications according to their preferences or project requirements.

## 1.5. Common Problems in Current Frameworks Addressed by Valyrian.js

Valyrian.js tackles several common challenges encountered in popular frameworks:

1. **Performance Overhead:** Many frameworks introduce significant additional code that can impact performance, especially on resource-constrained mobile devices. Valyrian.js minimizes this overhead, providing a more agile experience.

2. **Complex Performance Optimizations:** Achieving optimal performance in the fastest frameworks like Inferno.js or Svelte can be challenging and may require extensive tuning with unconventional APIs. Valyrian.js is designed with performance in mind, offering efficient rendering and updates out of the box without the need for complex configurations.

3. **Complex Configuration:** Setting up and optimizing applications in large frameworks can be complicated and may require multiple additional tools. Valyrian.js simplifies this process with more direct configurations and built-in tools.

4. **Inefficient Server-Side Rendering:** Some frameworks do not adequately optimize SSR, negatively affecting SEO and load times. Additionally, certain frameworks require different structures or modifications to enable SSR. Valyrian.js implements an efficient server-side component rendering system, enhancing these crucial aspects seamlessly.

5. **Steep Learning Curve:** Robust frameworks often come with a steep learning curve due to their complexity and numerous concepts. Valyrian.js offers a simpler API and modular structure, making it easier for new developers to adopt.
