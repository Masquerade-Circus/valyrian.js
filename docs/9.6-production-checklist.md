# 9.6. Production Checklist

Use this checklist before release. It is split into app runtime checks and docs quality checks.

## A) App Release Checklist

Run these in staging with realistic traffic/concurrency:

1. Confirm SSR route rendering + error handlers for success/failure paths ([./7.1-ssr.md](./7.1-ssr.md)).
2. Confirm Node URL rewriting and request-scoped headers per incoming request ([./7.2-isomorphic-networking-and-storage.md](./7.2-isomorphic-networking-and-storage.md)).
3. Confirm request-scoped context isolation under concurrent SSR requests ([./7.4-server-context.md](./7.4-server-context.md)).
4. Confirm route-level lazy chunks resolve on direct URL access and refresh.
5. Confirm service worker update strategy (`prompt-user`, `auto`, `manual`) matches product behavior ([./7.3.1-sw-runtime.md](./7.3.1-sw-runtime.md)).
6. If using offline queue, verify retry/backoff and recovery actions (`retryOne`, `retryAll`, `discardFailed`) ([./4.2.6-offline.md](./4.2.6-offline.md)).
7. If using native store in Node, confirm `valyrian.js/node` is imported before store creation ([./8.3-native-store.md](./8.3-native-store.md)).
8. If using translations in Node SSR, confirm request language isolation under concurrency ([./8.1-translate.md](./8.1-translate.md), [./7.4-server-context.md](./7.4-server-context.md)).

## B) Documentation QA Checklist

1. Confirm docs links resolve and point to current `n.m` files.
2. Confirm code snippets reflect tested runtime behavior (no stale APIs/options).
3. Confirm contract vs guidance wording is explicit (hard guarantees vs recommended patterns).
4. Confirm chapter hubs and subpages do not duplicate full mechanics already covered elsewhere.
5. Confirm SSR examples keep request isolation visible (`ServerStorage.run`, per-request `request.new`, per-request router).

Run both sections before release to keep runtime and documentation quality aligned.
