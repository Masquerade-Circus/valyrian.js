# 4. Building Single Page Applications (SPA Hub)

This chapter is a hub. Each subsystem has its own focused page.

If you are adopting Valyrian for the first time, follow these pages in order and add modules gradually.

## 4.1. Routing and Navigation

* File: [./4-routing-and-navigation.md](./4-routing-and-navigation.md)
* Covers `valyrian.js/router`, `mountRouter`, route lifecycle hooks, and `v-route`.

## 4.2. Data Fetching and Async Workflows (Hub)

* File: [./4-data-fetching-and-async.md](./4-data-fetching-and-async.md)
* Subpages:
  * [./4-request.md](./4-request.md)
  * [./4-suspense.md](./4-suspense.md)
  * [./4-tasks.md](./4-tasks.md)
  * [./4-query.md](./4-query.md)
  * [./4-network.md](./4-network.md)
  * [./4-offline.md](./4-offline.md)

## 4.3. Forms

* File: [./4-forms.md](./4-forms.md)
* Covers `FormStore`, `v-form`, `v-field`, validation, transforms, and submit orchestration.

## Suggested Reading Order

1. Start with routing.
2. Add request/query/tasks/offline/network modules as your app grows.
3. Add `FormStore` when forms move beyond simple local state.

Suggested pacing:

* Routing page: 15-25 minutes
* Data fetching page: 20-35 minutes
* Forms page: 15-30 minutes
